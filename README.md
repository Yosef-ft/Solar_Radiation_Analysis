# MoonLight Energy Solutions: Strategic Solar Investment Analysis

## Project Overview
MoonLight Energy Solutions is committed to advancing its operational efficiency and sustainability through carefully targeted solar investments. The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of environmental data to identify key trends and insights that will inform a strategic plan for solar installation. The analysis will focus on pinpointing high-potential regions for solar investments that align with the company's long-term sustainability goals.

## Objectives
* Operational Efficiency: Enhance the efficiency of MoonLight Energy Solutions through strategic solar investments.
* Sustainability: Align solar installation efforts with long-term sustainability goals.
* Data-Driven Strategy: Use statistical analysis and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify high-potential regions for solar installations.
## Tasks and Analysis
1. Summary Statistics:
* Calculate key statistical measures (mean, median, standard deviation) for each numeric column to understand data distribution.
2. Data Quality Check:
* Identify and handle missing values, outliers, or incorrect entries, particularly in solar radiation data (GHI, DNI, DHI) and sensor readings (ModA, ModB).
3. Time Series Analysis:
* Analyze temporal patterns and trends in solar radiation and temperature data. Evaluate the impact of cleaning on sensor readings over time.
4. Correlation Analysis:
* Investigate relationships between solar radiation components and temperature measures. Analyze the correlation between wind conditions and solar irradiance.
5. Temperature Analysis:
* Examine the influence of relative humidity (RH) on temperature readings and solar radiation.
6. Histograms:
* Visualize the frequency distribution of key variables such as GHI, DNI, DHI, and temperature.
7. Z-Score Analysis:
* Calculate Z-scores to identify data points that deviate significantly from the mean.
8. Bubble Charts:
* Explore complex relationships between variables using bubble charts.

## Strategic Report
The final output will be a strategic report that translates the analysis into actionable recommendations. This report will:

* Identify high-potential regions for solar installation.
* Align solar investment strategies with long-term sustainability goals.
* Provide data-driven insights to enhance operational efficiency.
